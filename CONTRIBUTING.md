# Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to `chessmate`, please feel free to reach
out [to me](mailto:jiaming.justin.chen@gmail.com)! I'm more than willing and available to discuss any ideas and answer any questions you may have. There's no minimum level of contribution or skill required; we all start off somewhere.

To make things easy, check out the issues or suggestions marked as [good first issue](https://github.com/sansona/chessmate/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) 

### Style
`chessmate` utilizes [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) for general formatting and [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for overall style. Using an automatic pep8 enforcer such as [autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) followed by `isort` and `black` would ensure all code follows the same standards.

### Tests
Each new contribution should have corresponding test coverage. I'd like to retain >90% coverage on ```chessmate``` via. [coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.1/). [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/) is a good option for killing two birds with one stone.

### Resources
I recommend the following resources to learn about computational chess:
  - [chessprogramming](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page)
  - [Myopic Rhino series on Chess Programming](https://www.gamedev.net/articles/programming/artificial-intelligence/chess-programming-part-i-getting-started-r1014/)
